# pad_management

Documentation and tools for managing DataONE hackmd and etherpad
instances.

There are basically two components here:

1. An [indexer](padindex/) that populates an
   [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
   instance with text and metadata from hackmd pads, etherpads, and the
   etherpad archives.

2. A [web interface](web/) that lists pads based on search criteria.

More details are in the respective folders.
